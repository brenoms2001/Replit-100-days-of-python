# Secret Diary
## This exercise stants for Days 62 and 72 solution
This exercise is to implement a secret diary, with the users credentials to assert their identity, manipulating a database and python data structures. In my solution I implemented registering and login functions which are saved in the database (with hashed passwords and salt) and then work with a dictionary (the value of the username key) to save all the diary entries.
